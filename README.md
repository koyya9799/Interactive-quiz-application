I created a dynamic and interactive quiz application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, developed entirely in Visual Studio Code. The app allows users to answer multiple-choice questions and receive instant feedback on whether their selection is correct or not. Questions are loaded dynamically one at a time, and the interface updates smoothly as the user progresses through the quiz. JavaScript handles the core functionality, including question rendering, answer checking, score tracking, and showing the final result. HTML structures the content, while CSS is used to design a clean and responsive user interface. The result is a polished and user-friendly quiz experience that gives real-time feedback and keeps track of the user's score throughout the session.
